    <h2>What?</h2>
    <p>
      A system that allows students to manipulate arithmetic expressions and algebraic expressions and equations.
    </p> 
    
    <section>
      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
        I believe that one of the reasons why students struggle so much with algebra is that traditional teaching methods
        require students to do too many tasks at the same time.  In this case of learning algebra this includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>symbolic manipulation</li>
        <li>abstract thinking</li>
        <li>artihmetic</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A system for manipulating math expressions and equations can help isolate these skills.  As a student develops each
        skill in isolation the system could be adjusted so that the student works on all skills together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Algebra starts off easy.  Students may be give an equation like "x + 5 = 10" which can be translated to something
        less formal such as "something plus five is ten".  Students can use informal reasoning to deduce that "five plus
        five is ten" and thus x must be 5.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach can only take students so far.  To solve more complicated problems such as quadratic equations, a
        completely different kind of thinking must be used that combines symbolic manipulation, abstract thinking, and
        arithmetic.
      </p>

      <h2>How?</h2>
      <p>
        Symbolic manipulation can be taught without using variables.  Numbers themselves are a type of symbol.  Students
        do this already to some extent when add fractions.  I propose that before introducing algebraic manipulation (symbolic
        manipulation of expressions/equations involving variables) that symbolic manipulation of arithmetic expressions
        be taught.  The emphasis here should be on the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a single value can have many equivalent arithmetic expressions</li>
        <li>we can convert one arithmetic expression to another using various rules</li>
        <li>these rules are built on axioms (assumptions)</li>
        <li>new rules can be derived from existing rules or from the axioms</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In order to learn and practice symbol manipulation the system can provide various levels of scaffolding.  At the
        start students could tap the various operators in an expression and be given the a list of possible transformations,
        e.g. evaluate, distribute, commute, convert subtraction to adding the negative, remove "+ 0", remove "* 1", factoring, etc.
        When the student makes a choice the system would carry it out, manipulating the numbers for the student and doing
        any arithmetic operations as required.  The key is that there's no way that a student can make a mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tasks students might be might start with familiar tasks such as "evaluate an arithmetic expression" and then
        progressive to things like "evaluate an arithmetic expression in as many different orders as is possible".  We
        teach student PEDMAS but there is often leeway within that strict rule.  Also, being able to convert subtraction
        to adding the negative (and division to multiplying the reciprocal) open up many doors.
      </p>
      <p>
        This exercise is actually
        a creative exercise and should be framed as such.  Too often in math do we focus on the answer or the steps to get
        to particular answer.  With this exercise students have much more freedom.  They also don't have worry about making
        a mistake because the system on offers them possible choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other exercises might include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>evaluate an expression in the less number of operations</li>
        <li>transform an expression to a target expression</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As students progress some of the scaffolding can be remove.  Instead of only showing students which choices are
        possible they might be given the choice of many transformations and they have choose something valid.  The system
        would then validate the choice and give feedback if the choice was invalid, perhaps suggesting remediation if a
        particular mistaken was made too often.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of evaluation of arithmetic operations or prime factorization,
        the system might request that the student provide the correct value before proceeding.  Again, it can verify that
        value immediately before proceeding.  This eliminates issues where a student makes a mistake halfway through their
        work and they only find out at the end that this is the wrong answer.  Getting feedback sooner can help prevent a
        lot of frustration.
      </p>
      <p>
        As students build confidence this scaffolding can be gradually backed off maybe checking the
        last two steps then the last three steps.  Knowing how to find problems in a set of steps is a good skill to have,
        but if a student is struggling it should be taught in isolation before being integrated into their algebraic
        skill set.

      <h2>Prototype</h2>
      <p>
        WARNING: This is very much a work in progress.  Many things described in
        the "How?" section are not implemented and the things that are, are 
        incomplete.  For instance reducing fractions that contain variables does
        not work.
