# TODO #

## tests ##
- write tests for existing transforms
    - collect_like_terms [done]
    - commute [done]
    - distribute (forwards/backwards) [done]
    - evaluate [done]
    - modify
    - rewrite_zero
    - rewrite_mult_0
    - rewrite_division
    - rewrite_subtraction
    - simplify
    - simplify_mult_one
    - write_as_substraction
- write fraction tests

## ui ##
- create a landing page that users can choose from pre-canned examples [done]
- grow selection by tapping the node more than once (tap outside to deselect)
- move the modify text box so it's below the equation/expression

## transforms ##
- rewrite with a select with an equivalent expression
- support simplifying individual expressions, e.g. fractions
- prime factorization
- fix distribution so that the extra <mrow> is removed after distribution [done]
- substitution (useful for system of equations)
- splitting (useful for quadratics)
- collect like terms... 3x + 2x -> 5x

## rendering ##
- fix parentheses around fractions
- list of equations separate by commas

## history ##
- track which operations were done
- track which operands were involved in the operations
- line up equal signs when working with equations

## future ##
- workflows
    - show the answer and have students work towards it for equations and expressions

- arithmetic expression
- algebraic expression: go from one to another equavalent expression
- algebraic equation: 
    - find a path to the answer
    - find the most direct path
- do specific transforms:
    - convert standard - general forms

## curriculum ##
- arithmetic
    - fractions: + - * /
    - order of operations
    - integers
    - powers
- algebra
    - linear expressions and equations
    - rational expressions
    - quadratic equation
        - write a generator for these
    - circles
        - write a generator for these
